    "i began to take self-teaching myself programming seriously after college. i remembered how bloated my old programs were in college, and i wanted to learn how to get better.",
    "i began to teach myself basic web development with html, css, and javascript. i found that the best way for me to learn wasn't to follow tutorials, but to come up with a project idea and just CODE. once i dived in, my learning increased exponentially. i read docs in order to debug, discovered more efficient ways to do things, and increased the tools in my toolbelt to bring my projects to life.",
    "eventually, i knew i wanted to dive into react. i wanted a more efficient tool to create my projects. i began full stack open's react course and learned basic best practices. but as i mentioned, charging head-on into projects is how i learn best. my first project using react is this very own website! i've already learned so much.",

    "this friendship quiz, as you might be able to tell by the 'Ms.Nguyen', was created as a demo for my Girls Who Code club. i used is as an example for my students to create their own friendship quizzes to send to their friends. i would love to revamp this project in the future to incorporate the skills i've learned with react.",
    "this project was created as an experiement between creative coding and physical computing. users can click on each picture and a corresponding led light (hidden under a ceramic form i made) would light up in response. it was interesting to understand more about serial ports and how c++ operates on the computer through this project.",
